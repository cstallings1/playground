<section id="about">
<p>My name is Catie Stallings and I'm an aspiring software developer. I'll be attending Dev Bootcamp in the fall and am excited (and a little nervous!) to learn about this new world. I live in Suburban Chicago with my husband and cat. I recently quit my job to immerse myself in code; but when I'm not doing that you can find me in the kitchen or outdoors.
